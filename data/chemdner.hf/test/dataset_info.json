When\n    developing supervised named entity recognition (NER) systems, the\n    availability of a large, manually annotated text corpus is desirable.\n    Furthermore, large corpora permit the robust evaluation and comparison of\n    different approaches that detect chemicals in documents. We present the\n    CHEMDNER corpus, a collection of 10,000 PubMed abstracts that contain a\n    total of 84,355 chemical entity mentions labeled manually by expert\n    chemistry literature curators, following annotation guidelines specifically\n    defined for this task. The abstracts of the CHEMDNER corpus were selected\n    to be representative for all major chemical disciplines. Each of the\n    chemical entity mentions was manually labeled according to its\n    structure-associated chemical entity mention (SACEM) class: abbreviation,\n    family, formula, identifier, multiple, systematic and trivial. The\n    difficulty and consistency of tagging chemicals in text was measured using\n    an agreement study between annotators, obtaining a percentage agreement of\n    91. For a subset of the CHEMDNER corpus (the test set of 3,000 abstracts)\n    we provide not only the Gold Standard manual annotations, but also mentions\n    automatically detected by the 26 teams that participated in the BioCreative\n    IV CHEMDNER chemical mention recognition task. In addition, we release the\n    CHEMDNER silver standard corpus of automatically extracted mentions from\n    17,000 randomly selected PubMed abstracts. A version of the CHEMDNER corpus\n    in the BioC format has been generated as well. We propose a standard for\n    required minimum information about entity annotations for the construction\n    of domain specific corpora on chemical and drug entities. The CHEMDNER\n    corpus and annotation guidelines are available at:\n    ttp://www.biocreative.org/resources/biocreative-iv/chemdner-corpus/\n  }\n}\n",
