Information encoded in natural language in biomedical literature publications is only useful if efficient and reliable ways of accessing and analyzing that information are available. Natural language processing and text mining tools are therefore essential for extracting valuable information, however, the development of powerful, highly effective tools to automatically detect central biomedical concepts such as diseases is conditional on the availability of annotated corpora.This paper presents the disease name and concept annotations of the NCBI disease corpus, a collection of 793 PubMed abstracts fully annotated at the mention and concept level to serve as a research resource for the biomedical natural language processing community. Each PubMed abstract was manually annotated by two annotators with disease mentions and their corresponding concepts in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH ) or Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM ). Manual curation was performed using PubTator, which allowed the use of pre-annotations as a pre-step to manual annotations. Fourteen annotators were randomly paired and differing annotations were discussed for reaching a consensus in two annotation phases. In this setting, a high inter-annotator agreement was observed. Finally, all results were checked against annotations of the rest of the corpus to assure corpus-wide consistency.The public release of the NCBI disease corpus contains 6892 disease mentions, which are mapped to 790 unique disease concepts. Of these, 88% link to a MeSH identifier, while the rest contain an OMIM identifier. We were able to link 91% of the mentions to a single disease concept, while the rest are described as a combination of concepts. In order to help researchers use the corpus to design and test disease identification methods, we have prepared the corpus as training, testing and development sets. To demonstrate its utility, we conducted a benchmarking experiment where we compared three different knowledge-based disease normalization methods with a best performance in F-measure of 63.7%. These results show that the NCBI disease corpus has the potential to significantly improve the state-of-the-art in disease name recognition and normalization research, by providing a high-quality gold standard thus enabling the development of machine-learning based approaches for such tasks.The NCBI disease corpus, guidelines and other associated resources are available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Dogan/DISEASE/.},

    The automatic extraction of chemical information from text requires the
    recognition of chemical entity mentions as one of its key steps. When
    developing supervised named entity recognition (NER) systems, the
    availability of a large, manually annotated text corpus is desirable.
    Furthermore, large corpora permit the robust evaluation and comparison of
    different approaches that detect chemicals in documents. We present the
    CHEMDNER corpus, a collection of 10,000 PubMed abstracts that contain a
    total of 84,355 chemical entity mentions labeled manually by expert
    chemistry literature curators, following annotation guidelines specifically
    defined for this task. The abstracts of the CHEMDNER corpus were selected
    to be representative for all major chemical disciplines. Each of the
    chemical entity mentions was manually labeled according to its
    structure-associated chemical entity mention (SACEM) class: abbreviation,
    family, formula, identifier, multiple, systematic and trivial. The
    difficulty and consistency of tagging chemicals in text was measured using
    an agreement study between annotators, obtaining a percentage agreement of
    91. For a subset of the CHEMDNER corpus (the test set of 3,000 abstracts)
    we provide not only the Gold Standard manual annotations, but also mentions
    automatically detected by the 26 teams that participated in the BioCreative
    IV CHEMDNER chemical mention recognition task. In addition, we release the
    CHEMDNER silver standard corpus of automatically extracted mentions from
    17,000 randomly selected PubMed abstracts. A version of the CHEMDNER corpus
    in the BioC format has been generated as well. We propose a standard for
    required minimum information about entity annotations for the construction
    of domain specific corpora on chemical and drug entities. The CHEMDNER
    corpus and annotation guidelines are available at:
